# ☁️ Daily Cloud/DevOps Practice – Asmita Kolte

Welcome to my daily cloud engineering practice repo! This space is where I actively build, automate, and experiment with DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and scripting—focusing on continuous improvement and hands-on learning.

## 🔍 What’s This Repo About?

This repository tracks my **daily contributions** to the world of **Cloud Engineering, DevOps, and Scripting**. I work with **Azure**, **AWS**, **Terraform**, **CI/CD**, **Python**, **Kubernetes**, and automation tooling.

It includes:

- 🧠 Daily LeetCode practice to sharpen problem-solving.
- 🛠️ Real-world inspired Python and Bash automation scripts.
- ⚙️ Git automation with `auto_create.py` and `auto_push.py`.
- 📁 Daily folder structure by `day-N`, e.g., `day-6`, `day-7`.

## 🔄 CI/CD Learning Focus

As a Cloud and DevOps Engineer, I'm focused on building **automated, secure, and reliable CI/CD pipelines**. This repository reflects that:

- I am practicing **infrastructure automation** and **deployment pipelines** using GitHub Actions.
- The automation scripts here (like `auto_push.py`) mimic simplified CI/CD tasks—creating files, pushing commits, and triggering actions automatically.
- I am exploring how to integrate these pipelines with **Terraform**, **Linting**, **Tests**, and **Monitoring** to ensure code quality and fast, iterative delivery.
